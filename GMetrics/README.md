# GMetrics
Module with Numpy/Scipy and TensorFlow2 implementation of several metrics for
two-sample-tests and Generative models evaluation. The implementation allows to parallelize
the calculation of null-hypotheses, speeding up inference.

The module supports the following non-parammetric two sample test statistics:

- Dimension averaged Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test-statistic and p-value
- Sliced KS test-statistic
- Sliced Wasserstein Distance (SWD) test-statistic
- The Frobenius norm of the difference between the correlation matrices
- Unbiased Frechét Gaussian Distance (FGD)
- Maximum Mean Discrepacy (MMD) (the unbiased squared estimator with a polynomial kernel of arbitrary degree is implemented)

The module also includes the parametric test-statistic for the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) 
(computed from the known PDFs), that, when both PDFs are known, 
can be used as proxy of "best estimator" by the Neyman-Pearson lemma.
